## Topic
Are walkability and affordability mutually exclusive? That is to say, are so-called "walkable" neighborhoods financially out of reach
for less affluent people?

See if there is a correlation between HH transportation spend and walkable areas
Unsupervised ML, cluster tracts

What is walkable? Split index on 10? Classification problem (see machine learning lessons)

Classification Problem: use all income variables from Affordability dataset as IndVar; Walkable/Non-walkable target variable. Use Logistic Regression.
