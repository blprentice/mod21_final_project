## Topic

Do so-called "walkable" areas reduce transportation costs? One of the major claims advocates of "walkability" make is that living in more walkable areas - which also includes cycling and transit use - people drive cars less, which has many positive benefits. One of those benefits is a reduction in transportation costs, as people don't have to spend as much money on gas or vehicle repair and maintenance.

I chose this topic because I've long been an advocate for more "walkable" areas myself. However, I've never really taken the time to investigate for myself whether the supposed benefits of living in a more "walkable" area actually materialize. There are many different benefits I could test, but I've chosed to focus on walkable areas as they relate to transportation costs. I plan to use data to discover if transportation costs eat up a lower percantage of median income in more "walkable" areas than less "walkable" areas.

## Research Questions

* Do more walkable areas show evidence of lower transportation costs when compared with less walkable areas?
* Do families in 8 different household types, as defined by the United States Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Transportation (DOT), spend a lower percentage of their income on transporation than those same household types in less walkable areas?

## Data

* National Walkability Index
    * Organization: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Sustainable Communities
    * Publication date: 20210513
    * The Index measures the relative walkability of communities in the USA at the block group level

* Location Affordability Index
    * Organization: HUD, DOT
    * Publication date: 201903 (uses 2012-2016 ACS data)
    * Data set covers the entire USA and provides "robust, standardized household housing and transportaiton cost estimates at the census tract level.
